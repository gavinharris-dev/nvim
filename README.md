# NeoVim Settings

Here I will keep my current NeoVim settings, this is a mixture of LazyVim keybindings
built upon @ThePrimeagen base set-up.

## Install

Clone this repo into your `~/.config/nvim` directory, open NeoVim and then `:so ~/.config/nvim/lua/gav/packer.lua`

Now run `:PackerSync` and restart VIM.

## Exit NeoVim

`:q` or `<leader>qq` works fine for me! Haha
